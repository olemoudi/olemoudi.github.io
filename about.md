I am a Security Engineer interested in Web and Mobile Security. I sometimes ~~rant~~ write about secure development, trends, no-nonsense security and trade-offs.

I am also a small-timer in Vulnerability Reward & Bug Bounty Programs. Definitely not a top researcher but got my chances to shine here and there and get some bounties along the way.
