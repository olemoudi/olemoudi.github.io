$FAQ_INTRO_ANSWER_P1 = "<p>Everyday we cross paths with a lot of strangers. We see them and we forget about them quickly. However, sometimes we see someone who conveys something more and who we instantly feel attracted to. Maybe you exchange gazes. Maybe you smile to each other. Maybe you both are wondering if the other person feels the same way. What could be done?</p>";

$FAQ_INTRO_ANSWER_P2 = "<p>seeshy is the first search engine to find people you don't know but would like to. Finding that particular person may be easier than you think. It only takes both of you to want it to happen, leave the rest to us. Filling out a simple form will place you only a step away from that person you think you won't see ever again. So stop dreaming and start acting, searching now. Someone could be already searching for you right now!</p>";

$FAQS[] = array('How does this work?',
				'<p>The actual process is very simple:</p><ol> 
<li>Locate on the map the place and state the time of your last encounter with this person. </li>
<li>Add a brief description about you and this person you are looking for. </li> </ol><p>With all this data, the system will try to create the best possible match between you and some other person using seeshy. For all this to work, both persons (you and your target) should be searching for each other in seeshy.</p><p>Once a possible match is found, each candidate receives a notification and is invited to confirm a correct match. After both candidates confirm the match, seeshy sends their respective emails to the candidate they validated.</p> ');

$FAQS[] = array("What happens if I'm not very accurate marking the place?",
				"<p>No problemo, as long as you don't miss by a big distance. The search has a tolerance radius of about 200 meters, so you've got enough space to miss the shot.</p>");

$FAQS[] = array('What if the place was a train, plane or bus?',
				'<p>If it was in a moving vehicle, just point the place where you lost visual contact with this person (station, airport...)</p>');

$FAQS[] = array("What if I'm mistaken about the age, hair or any other thing?",
				"<p>Don't worry about it. seeshy is not very nitpicky with details. Nailing a perfect description is good for your search, but don't become obsessed with the possibility of making some mistakes. We look at the big picture so it doesn't really matter if you answer wrongly a couple of questions.</p>");

$FAQS[] = array('How long does it take to get results from a search?',
				'<p>seeshy deletes pending searches 15 days after the moment you submit them. This means that if you send your search today, the person you are looking for has 2 weeks to do the same with you, ensuing a match. After that period your search will be deleted from the directory.</p>');

$FAQS[] = array("What if they don't search for me?",
				"<p>If after 15 days your search does not return a single result, we will inform you so you can try again if you like. Unfortunately things do not always turn out happily and it is a possibility that your search won't return any results.</p>");

$FAQS[] = array("Will you look at the message I'll write to this person?",
				'<p>No. seeshy is very concerned about your privacy and we have no intention or interest whatsoever in reading the details of placed searches. You can count on that.</p>');

$FAQS[] = array('If I give you my email address, will you spam the crap out of me?',
				"<p>No. In fact, we couldn't even if we wanted to because we won't store your email after our work is done. Once your search has expired we will delete all your data and stop knowing anything about you.</p>");

$FAQS[] = array("Can my search find someone different from the one I'm looking for?",
				"<p>Yes, it could likely happen. Some locations are hot spots for meeting strangers (pubs, discos, stations...). In these cases it's possible that your search could return more than one result. If this happens, read carefully each of the messages the candidates wrote to decide which one is the person you are looking for. Remember you can only validate one candidate for your search as the one you want to get in contact with.</p>");

$FAQS[] = array('Does my search expire?',
				'<p>Yes, after 15 days we will delete your search and your data from the directory.</p>');

$FAQS[] = array("seeshy acts weird in my browser",
	'<p>seeshy is optimized for the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Chrome. If you find seeshy doing weird things, please upgrade your browser or try with another one</p>');

$FAQS[] = array("You have set up all this to get chicks didn't you?",
				'<p>You got us. Actually, we are veeeeeery shy and this is only a big excuse for getting girls :D</p>');
